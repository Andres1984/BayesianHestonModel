Decomposing Market Prices in Speculative Environments: A Bayesian Asset Pricing Framework for Crypto-Assets

##  Overview

In speculative markets such as crypto-assets‚Äîwhere fundamental value is unobservable or undefined, and investor behavior is shaped by sentiment and fragmented information‚Äîtraditional asset pricing models fall short. This project proposes a novel approach to short-term price modeling by decomposing observed market prices into three latent components:

- **Theoretical Value**
- **Systematic Bias** (driven by perceived risk and optimism)
- **Behavioral Noise** (capturing uncoordinated investor behavior)

The model integrates a **Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF)** into a **Bayesian hierarchical Heston framework**, allowing the estimation of both volatility dynamics and pricing distortions in a probabilistic structure.

##  Empirical Focus

- Application to the  Top 10 Crypto-Assets Binance 
- Estimation performed under the real-world probability measure (ùôø) to capture short-term investment behavior
- Emphasis on the interpretation of volatility as an indicator of coordination failure and market noise
